### Angular Pros
- Modularity;
- How we can use components with modules;
- How we can use dependency injection;
- There are many “pros” out of the box as a router, form validation, HttpClient, etc;
- The high level of control;
- Unlike React, Angular enables normal usage of HTML and CSS along with all their features and advantages.

### Angular Cons
- It can be a little bit uneasy for inexperienced developers to work with it, especially when they have not got a sufficient background in JavaScript;
-  Angular is rather fluid. Every new version differs greatly from the previous version, which results in distrust of the framework;
- A developer is limited if he/she wants to create a single-page application. There is no possibility to just drop it into your full stack or a multi-page application.

## Vue
![Vue](/img/vuejs-cover.png)
Vue.js is a breath of fresh air and a framework that was launched in 2014 and 2016.

It is used for the creation of interactive interfaces. To imagine how it works, let’s picture that Vue.js is an extramarital child of Angular and React (a good deal of brilliant ideas from these two projects were successfully realized in Vue.js). The framework has been chosen by Alibaba, Nintendo, Expedia, and multiple other small projects.

### Top Apps and Websites Developed with Vue


### Vue Pros
- JavaScript code, templates, and CSS code are not mixed as they are in React;
- It is possible to use ES5, ES6, as well as TypeScript (yet it can be harder to set up);
- As with React, Vue quite easily interacts with other libraries or even projects;
- Vue’s documentation is quite comprehensible and well-structured. This makes it easy to get started.

### Vue cons
- Vue.js is at a disadvantage to Angular considering the modular concept (e.g., there is dependency injection);
- It’s relatively new and doesn’t have endorsement compared to Angular (backed by Google) and React (backed by Facebook).

## Conclusion
So what should you choose? To tell the truth, all three options discussed here are quite beneficial. Nevertheless, it’s really hard to point out the best one. Just consider all the pros and cons and go with your gut.


Your solution is **Angular** if you:
- Like TypeScript;
- Like object-oriented-programing (OOP);
- Want to create a scalable app;
- Would like to engage many developers in the project;
- Work with designers and need clean HTML.

Your solution is **Vue.js** if you:
- Are a fan of a clean code;
- Are looking for the simplest learning curve;
- Need a lightweight framework;
- Work alone or with a small team;
- Need clean HTML files.
